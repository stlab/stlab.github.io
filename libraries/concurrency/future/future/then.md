brief: Creates a continuation on the current future.
declaration: then()
example: [then_continuation_example.cpp, then_split_example.cpp, then_reduction_example.cpp]
description: |
  Creates a new continuation on the current object. 

  Multiple `then()` invocations on the same future object realize a split. The result of this will be copied into all continuations.

  If the return type is of type `future<T>` or `future<void>`, then the return type will automatically reduced to `T` or `void`. (So far this is not supported for move-only types.) 

  If `T` of `future<T>` is a move only type, then a split is not possible of course.
